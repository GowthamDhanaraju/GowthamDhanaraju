## üöÄ Projects
Here are some of my key projects, including those with available code on GitHub:

### **CVD Detection and Correction (Mobile App)**
* [cite_start]Developed a mobile app using **React Native** to detect and correct the effects of color vision deficiency (CVD) in real-time[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]Implemented **CNN + GAN models** for perceptual correction and enhanced color contrast[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]Achieved real-time correction on mobile devices, improving perceptual clarity by ~30% in user tests[cite: 45].
* [cite_start]**[GitHub](https://github.com/GowthamDhanaraju/CVD-detection-and-correction)** [cite: 39]

### **Intruder Defence System**
* [cite_start]Engineered a defense turret with a **CNN-based intruder recognition system** and CBAM attention modules[cite: 31].
* [cite_start]Integrated **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino** for servo-based turret control[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]Achieved over 90% recognition accuracy during real-time testing[cite: 32].

### **Image Captioning with Emotion Recognition**
* [cite_start]Combined facial emotion recognition with object detection to generate contextual captions[cite: 35].
* [cite_start]Used **CNNs** to extract facial features and **Transformer decoders** to generate captions[cite: 35].
* [cite_start]The system achieved an ~85% BLEU score, providing captions enriched with emotion context[cite: 36].

### **University Management System**
* [cite_start]Created a full-stack academic platform using **React, Next.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL**[cite: 51].
* [cite_start]The system automates student records, course registration, and administrative workflows[cite: 52].
* [cite_start]**[GitHub](https://github.com/GowthamDhanaraju/University-Management-System)** [cite: 56]
